## Overview

DevTinder is a **MERN stack application** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) built to help developers connect and collaborate.

The project follows a **microservices architecture**, divided into two main services:

- **Frontend Service**
  - Handles UI and client-side logic
  - Built using React

- **Backend Service**
  - Handles server-side logic
  - Provides REST APIs
  - Manages database interactions

## What is Express Framework?

**Express.js** is a **minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js**.  
It makes server-side development easier by providing simple methods for handling requests, responses, routing, and middleware.

### Why use Express?
- Built on top of Node.js
- Reduces complex server code
- Makes APIs and web servers easy to create
- Widely used in real-world backend applications

### Key Features
- 🚀 Fast and lightweight
- 🧭 Easy routing system
- 🧩 Middleware support
- 🔌 Works well with databases and frontend frameworks
- 🌍 Industry-standard backend framework for Node.js

## 2. Installing Express

Install Express using npm:

```bash
npm install express
```
### What happens after installation?
- Express is added to the node_modules folder

- A new entry appears in package.json under dependencies

- You can now import and use Express in your project

## Key Files & Folders in a Node.js Project

When working with Node.js and Express, several important files and folders are created.

### 📁 node_modules
- Contains all installed npm packages and their dependencies

- Automatically created by npm

Purpose

- Stores libraries required by the project

Important Notes

- Do NOT edit manually

- Usually ignored in Git using .gitignore

- Can be recreated using:
```
npm install
```

### 📄 package.json
- The main configuration file of a Node.js project

- Stores project information and dependencies

Common Fields

`"name"` – Project name

`"version"` – Project version

`"description"` – Short project summary

`"dependencies"` – Packages needed in production

`"devDependencies"` – Packages used only during development

`"scripts"` – Custom commands (e.g. start, dev)

### 🔒 package-lock.json

- Automatically generated by npm

- Locks exact versions of dependencies

Purpose

- Ensures the same dependency versions are installed on all machines

- Prevents unexpected bugs due to version changes

### Other Important Files

### .gitignore

- Specifies files/folders Git should ignore

- Commonly ignores node_modules

### README.md

- Documentation file

- Explains project purpose, setup, and usage

### Server files src folder (e.g. app.js, server.js)

- Contains backend logic

## Creating a Basic Express Server

Example of a simple Express server:

```
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use("/test", (req, res) => {
    res.send("Server started");
});

app.use("/main", (req, res) => {
    res.send("Another route");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log("Server started running on port " + port);
});
```

Explanation

- `express()` creates an application instance

- `app.use()` defines routes

- `app.listen()` starts the server

- Server runs at: `http://localhost:3000`


## Understanding the -g Flag in npm
### What does -g mean?

- -g stands for global installation

### Local Installation (default)
```
npm install <package>
```

- Installed inside the project
- Used only in that project
- Added to package.json

### Global Installation
```
npm install -g <package>
```
- Installed system-wide
- Can be used from any directory
- Mostly used for CLI tools

Example
```
npm install -g nodemon
```

## Why Express is Popular

- Easy to learn
- Clean and readable code
- Flexible architecture
- Large community support
- Ideal for REST APIs and backend services

## Key Takeawys 
- Express simplifies Node.js server development
- npm manages dependencies efficiently
- Proper file structure keeps projects organized
- Global vs local installs serve different purposes
